|--------------|---------|
| student_id   | int     |
| student_name | varchar |

**student_id** is the primary key for this table.  
Each row contains the ID and name of one student in the school.

---

### Table: Subjects

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| subject_name | varchar |
